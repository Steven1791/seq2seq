the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppress is emotion

I will undertake to throw up 50 and when the day comes to defend them
I said Gandhi you will undertake then some night to throw up some 10 barricade
I think so the bigger I can undertake things more difficult and more important than that
good unemployed but active Souls Brawlers capable of Bringing Down the Walls of the Palais Royal by crying down with mazarin as fill those at Jericho

consider my yard so the cured that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful Lord and that I have made myself responsible for you

yes sir provided this war were approved by the church and would Advance the end I wish to attain I mean the remission of my sins
my friend said Gandhi you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take apart in a little Civil War should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have required over your comrade
I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produced nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there was a hand to guide
explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor
as to what it said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody
these are Melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor
the mendicant shook his head
there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite this guy's
said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water
with me
mayor begins accurate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little
the ladder and the coadjutor touch the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor through a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground
some of those men sometimes die with 20,000 and 25 and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more
the Rascal is Rich then
I believe this man paid his predecessor 100% Oles for his
no my Lord these places are bought
Gandhi looked at the spot indicated and perceived a bigger seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little Basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand
stop he said there he is at his post
on arriving at the Rood approve are  the cure a point or the square before the church
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seem not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing
the coadjutor in His companion pass through all the streets lying between the Archbishop Rick and the Santos test Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling
let us go and see your bigger sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure
certainly
and thank you that we should find him at this hour at his post
but I do not think it is is right

what makes you think so
nothing my Lord except that he is tormented with remorse
and what do you know of him

piers are you aware my Lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of Association of those who have nothing against those who have everything and Association in which everyone takes its share one that Alexa leader
and you say that he has a great influence over his
did Gandhi reflecting you are right sir someone who could raise the Legion of poppers who choked up the crossings of Paris someone who would know how to cry aloud to them that all friends might hear it that it is mazarin who is reduce them to poverty


I offer you a beggar my Lord
think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other account you are going into offer a prince are you

and now it is your turn to the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything is good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us
I know him also but unfortunately he is not in Paris

I my lord said the ladder I know a man who is rendered great services to a very popular prints and who would make an excellent leader of revolt
continued Gandhi turn into the Curative San Sueur peas

and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of France are caused by mess around her lover and her Destroyer begin this work today this instant and in three days I shall expect the result
Gandhi related to them the insults you had received at the Palais Royale
2 hours later
when once more alone going to be sent to summon all the curate's with whom he had any connection to his house
at midnight my dear monsieur louviere
at midnight mile or
good
if I should not be in wait for me
it is now noon at midnight I will be at your house
12 hours sir is it too long
and how many hours of reflection do you ask
never mind that the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection
for it to be welcome to you now
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and I will bring you the citizens and the Parliament with these four elements Paris is hours in a week and believe me miss your coadjutor the court will give from Fear what it will not give from
as for me I hate the cord and have but one desire at this moment vengeance
you are ambitious it is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth
30000 crowns in arms has not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be to Grant
from the depth of my heart said Gandhi
best lube
is that true and do you speak seriously
my dear Monsieur louviere said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for The Misfortune which is happened to you
but whilst they were indulging in extravagant Joy at the Palais Royale to increase the hilarity of the queen Meza ran a man of sense and Jews fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his goal
I will teach you how to laugh tomorrow but in another manner
he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly Court

Gandhi withdrew Distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherence of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet
said he just has a bad look I just like these quarrels among men of the church
then turning toward porthos the devil
yes my Lord he replied
you will remember that man who is just going out to will you not
yes Madam replied the coadjutor  I have to beg you to reflect twice
the queen of last asked him if he had anything to add to the find this course he had just made to her
remain calm and Stern
said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the Parliament and the citizens of Paris his Holiness The coadjutor Who by a signal could raise an army of carrots Church Porter
this caused the universal burst of laughter
the fool of the Court explained that the queen was very happy to have the sucker of religion at such a moment
immediately the width of the Court plunged into satire
the only one which could be caught at by the Joker's and turned around and directed a glance toward your favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their Tender Mercies
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him
he therefore hasten to the Palace to congratulate the queen on the Battle of lens determine beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill receive
Monsieur de rents wish to become Archbishop in his uncle's place and Cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty Accord him favors so entirely Royal
although almost engaged to the leaders of the front he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutor ship was but a stepping stone
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mess around and requesting the Archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he's so much enjoyed giving
Cry of surprise ran through the Royal assembly
in the regimen said D'Artagnan he is called porthos the queen started but his true name
that's the queen
his name
permit me with them so D'Artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words and ancient musketeer of the company of trivia
I know that sir I have known that so the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my Steam
and that I shall only be happy the day I lose it for you
D'Artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become Lieutenant of the Musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him
speak D'Artagnan speak
without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the Nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river
I'm a damn said, hastening to D'Artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector
Comanche was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and everyone was listening to his account when D'Artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the card
D'Artagnan and porthos pointed to their Dusty and torn dresses but the Cardinals shook his head
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the Zeal of his two Defenders if he procured them personal things from the queen motion them to follow him
whilst the two friends were with a cardinal the queen sent for him
D'Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform  but though we held the Cardinals promises as of little worth He affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely D'Artagnan is Captain see porthos is barren
the bigger of Santa stash  D'Artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royale he would give Comanche time to arrive before him and consequently to make the Cardinal acquainted with the eminent Services which he D'Artagnan and his friend had rendered to the Queen's party in the morning

this was the grandfather
and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his finger a door opened at the end of the drawing room and a long pallet figure made its appearance
a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself
from time to time he made a negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which he had in Woodley addressed to himself
the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly
the porter candle enhance light it then
a full Pell was threatened in an instant
beside the bed three candles burned on the table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out

she said herself to telling her beads in her own chamber
on perceiving that they were undressing Maurice withdrew
the doctor examines Mars and after having found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils he hadn't placed flat on the bed without a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a trifle lower and with his bust bear in order to facilitate respiration
at the physician's orders a camp bed beside the sofa
she did not go so far as I told you so which is customary on this sort of occasion
and took form in the exclamation
a timeshare
the Doctor Who had been sent for had hasten feather
chapter 12 the grandfather  bosc and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room motionless on the sofa upon which he had been placed in his arrival
Bingley was quite uncomfortable his sister's declared that they were miserable
this she would not hear up but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers is proposal and it was settled that mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning if Miss Bennet we're not decidedly better
Bingley urged mr. Jones being sent for immediately while his sister is convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an Express to town for one of the most eminent position
Elizabeth join them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject
undoubtedly replied Darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the Arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever Bears Affinity to cunning is Despicable
Elizabeth Bennet said Miss Bingley when the door was closed on her a very mean aunt
as all conversation was there by at an end Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room
mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the Injustice of her implied out and we're both protest in that they knew many women who answered this description when mr. Hurst call them and order with bitter complaints there in attention to what was going forward
I never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe United
are you so severe pain your own sex that stood out the possibility of all this
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished with
add a Darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the Improvement of her mind by extensive reading
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of Music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word
yes I do comprehend a great deal in
nor I I am sure said Miss Bingley  then observed Elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal and your idea of an accomplished woman
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but I am very far from agreeing with you and your estimation of ladies in general
countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much
how I long to see her again
she is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet tight or rather toddler
I think she will
send Miss Bingley will she be as tall as I am
I am talking of possibilities Charles
I'll be sure with all my heart I will buy pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it
there is not a final counting England than
but I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighborhood and take pemberley for a kind of model
Charles would you build your house I wish it may
it ought to be good and replied it has been the work of many generations
what is the life of a library you have at pemberley mr. Darcy
I am astonished that Miss Bingley but my father should have left so small a collection of books
and I wish my collection were larger for your benefits and my own credit but I am an idle fellow and though I have not many I have more than I ever looked into
he immediately offered to fetch her others all of his library before.
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
Miss Eliza Bennet said Miss Bingley despises cards
city that is rather singular
do you prefer reading to cards
mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at Lou and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing High she declined it and making her sister the excuse that she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book
she was still very poorly and Elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather write than pleasant but she should go downstairs herself
and sat with her till some into coffee
to this speech Bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their Hardy sent and indulge them Earth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied Darcy
it would not make them one jot less agreeable
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily
yes and I have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
but with such a father and mother and such low connections I am afraid there is no chance of it
a short pause followed this speech and mrs. Hurst Begin Again  disregard for Miss Jane Bennet she is really a very sweet girl and I wish with all my heart she were well set
you replied they were brightened by the exercise
I'm afraid mr. Darcy observe Miss Bingley and 1/2 whisper that this adventure has rather that did your admiration of her fine eyes
could Bingley
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles
your picture may be very exact Louisa said Bingley but this was all lost upon me
6 in deep in mud I am absolutely certain and the Gown which have been let down to hide it not doing its office
she really looked almost Wild  she did indeed Louisa
I shall never forget her appearance this morning
she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent Walker
Miss Bingley was engrossed by mr. Darcy her sister scarcely less so and that's for mr. Hurst by whom Elizabeth that he was an indolent man who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her
the brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they dislike being ill themselves and then I thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane would not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike
Jane was by no means better
to the Civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much Superior solicitude of mr. bingley's she could not make a very favorable answer
D'Artagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection
begone begone  at these words she opened the door of the car door and push start engine out of the room
Italian  I know. What you will find at home will tell you

but where and when should I see you again
said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came
silence
cried D'Artagnan
you at last
the sound of voices diminish by degrees in the adjoining chamber the company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which D'Artagnan was was open
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun supper was to be served at 3 and the clock of Saint Jean had struck 3/4 past 2
after the reward of his devotion back of his love was to come
obscurity  dartanian place the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet over
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring the door immediately closed and D'Artagnan found himself again in complete
he cast himself on his knees sees the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips
at length of a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry dartanian at once comprehended that this was his recompense
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of
the queen appear cheerful and happy which seem to astonish the person so surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listen
but sooner ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed are which reached him from the same aperture  the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in the closet attached to the Queens apartment
there she met a fresh sign of silence and open the second door concealed by tapestry the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared
all the way and in proportion is the corridors became more deserted dartanian wish to stop the young woman sees her and gaze upon her where it's only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which you must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint at length after winding about for a minute or two which was entirely dark and led D'Artagnan into it
move by a double sentiment love and curiosity
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the Queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard Jermaine were there dartanian had sent for her
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized as usual guide the light and intelligence
the queen had just regained her chamber and D'Artagnan was about to retire when he felt this shoulder lightly touched he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her
to whom Anne of Austria o the extraordinary Triumph she had obtained over the Cardinal and who confounded or known lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors the king the queen his Eminence sent himself

the king opened it and found in it to diamond studs
this was the costume that best became the king so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom
the king came out first from his room he was in a most elegant hunting costume and Misha and the other nobles were dressed like him
the violins begin to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them has spoken so low that everybody out of respect with Drew several steps so that nobody had heard anything
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly
do so Madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will come
Cyrus at the queen I can send for them to the Louvre where they are and dust your Majesty's wishes will be complied with
the voice of the King was tremulous with anger everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed
he went straight to the queen and then an altar boy said why am I Dom have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification  the queen cast a glance around her and saw the Cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance
the Cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice in The King was very pale
all at once the king appeared with the Cardinal at one of the doors of the hall
the queen remain for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible Joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs
at the moment she entered the curtain of the small Gallery which two that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the Cardinals appeared he being dressed as a Spanish cover
the queen entered the Great Hall and it was remarked that like the king she look dull and even weary

D'Artagnan intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy Mercer but the ladder made so polite and friendly a salutation what is tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him
exactly so sit D'Artagnan and nodding to flush a he went out

it's a window had been open or even a jar I should think nothing of it but no all is hermetically sealed
it is not natural for letters to enter people's houses in this manner
and where is that letter
I mean to say that when I came in although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket I found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom
what do you mean black
but one has come of itself
I start hanging eagerly
and he had sent home two hours before from the hotel-de-ville telling him to sit up for him open the door for him
he found the door of his passage open spring up the stairs and not softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his Lackey
close before him so close that he could have almost touched him before he started back with his eyes peering into the room and meeting his there's to The Chew
if you buried him 50 feet deep and took me across his grave I fancy I should know if there wasn't a mark above it there there
suddenly the scene change
Oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room that his books were lying on the table before him that the Sweet Air was stirring among the treating plants outside and yes he was asleep
it is an undoubted fact that Although our senses of touch and sight to be for the time dead yet are sleeping. And the Visionary scenes that passed before us will be influenced and material influenced by the mirror challenge presence of some external object which may not have been near us when we closed her eyes and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness
nor is this the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state
so far is an overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all this going on about us and if we dream at such a Time Words which are really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate themselves with surprising Readiness to our Visions until reality and Imagination become so strangely Blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two
there's a kind of sleep that steals, sometimes which while it holds the body prisoner does not free the Mind from a sense of things about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure
pick up to over the casement and filled the place with their Delicious Perfume it looks into a garden once a week it's Gates opened into a small Paddock I'll be on to his find metal and wood
the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his books
it was while he was engaged in this Pursuit that he was greatly startled and distressed by most unexpected occurrence
yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now and then for a short distance with mrs. Maley he applied himself with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the white-headed Old Gentleman and labored so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself
Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away all those a little vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that whatever the doctor came into the garden he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner
it is worthy of remark and Oliver did not fail to know that at the time that his morning Expeditions were no longer made a loan
they do seem to Sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the air to Russell among them with a suite of Music are in the right but the summer colors are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts the real heroes are delicate and need a Clear Vision
The Melancholy would seem to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days passed over every object beautiful as all were misspells by Magic
the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places and the sweetest wildflowers that could be found where once more gathered to Gladden rose with their beauty
Oliver Rose next morning and better heart and went about his usual occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days
and it was late before they were tired with lights and thankful Hearts to take that rest of which after the Delton suspense had recently undergone they stood much in need
SS the two women servants lifted up their hands and eyes and suppose that mr. Giles pulling out his shirt frail replied no no and wherewithal as original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of Great Men, they are
admirably pray Hospital
well said the doctor I am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing
none at all sir replied mr. Giles with much gravity
said the doctor
nor catching any thieves nor identifying any house Breakers
nothing particular sir replied mr. Giles coloring up to the eyes
inquired the doctor when he had concluded
have you shot anything particular lately Giles
the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients situation which was quite as kinsella Tori and full of Promise is Oliver statement had encouraged him to Hope and to the whole of which mr. Giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listen to with greedy ears
I shall see you again tonight said the young man a girl
God bless you
I must go back to her
that I leave you to discover replied mrs. maisel
what do you mean
no indeed replied his mother you have for a mistake too strong a hold on her affections already
urge to the young man she has formed no other attachment
housing
not coldly rejoins the old lady far from it
there's something in your manner which would almost to imply that she will hear me coldly mother said the young man
she shall said mrs. maley
before I leave this place Rochelle hear me
no
and why should I suffer the pain of a delay and giving them bent which can be productive of no earthly good
mother think better of this end of me
I have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great steak you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the win
and ever will said the young man
you think so now Harry replied his mother
mother said the young man and patiently he would be a selfish brute unworthy like of the name of man and of the woman you described who acted us
above all I think that the lady fixing her eyes on her son's face that is an enthusiastic and an exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him  he may no matter how generous and good his nature
I think my dear son returned to mrs. Maley letting her hand upon his shoulder that use has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting
do you still supposed that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
if I did not feel this
I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer said Mrs Millie I know that the devotion and affection of her nature required No Ordinary return but when the chill be deep and Lasting
the giant young man or why should I say if it is it is you know it mother you must know it
and who can wonder if it be so mother
if that had been the case Terry said mrs. Maley and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later
mrs. Maley was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage
notwithstanding the difference between Youth and age he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not already spoken of her as his mother
he seemed about 5 and 20 years of age and was as the middle height his countenance was Frank and handsome and his demeanor easy and prepossessing
as they walked along Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the newcomer
Emily and Oliver followed at their leisure
I beg your pardon mr. Harry so Giles giving a final polish to his Ruffles continents with the handkerchief but if you would leave the post boy to say that
you can say I am coming
I would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before I see her
that the honest fellow had not been finding emotion
I've been sitting on the steps of the chase supporting an elbow on each knee and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with white spots
do not deceive me by Awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled
demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice
there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there
you are quite certain
the change took place only a few hours ago and missed your last friend says that all danger is at an end  the gentleman said Not Another word but opening the chase Dart leaped out and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm let him aside
quite sir replied Oliver
you are sure
explains the gentleman
thank heaven
cry the gentleman Better or Worse better much better
in a word
Giles popped out his nightcap again Preparatory to making some reply when he was suddenly pulled back by Young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news
running up to the chase store
as he walks briskly along the road he heard behind him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace
the night was fast closing in when he returns home word Laden with flowers which he had called with peculiar care for the adornment of the sick chamber
he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening are a burst of tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost in support of a lot of Anguish which have been taken from his breast
Oliver's felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak or rest
2df from this point everything was a blank to Dante's he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been in prison
come to The Abbey closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story  Dante's obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of The Voyage to India and two or three voyages to the Levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of Captain the Claire and the receipt of a package to be delivered by himself to the Grand Marshal is interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to him on Shore North yeah his arrival at Marseille an interview with his father his affection for Mercedes and their nuptial feast his arrest and subsequent examination is temporary detention at the Palais de Justice and his final imprisonment in the show
my father and Mercedes
I would Fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you are perfectly unacquainted with mine
is yes but one of them let me hear the other
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have they have a smile
I know nothing
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and he were well aware that from the Collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination no reply.
compression is needed to explode gunpowder
as we have a smilingly imposing the Deep abstraction and which his visitor was plunged the excess of his all and wonder
what are you thinking of
well affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of Dante's was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear-sighted as a addict might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own Misfortune or he himself could see nothing
nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder and which Second Chance frequently brings about
I once thought continued Feria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see it's somewhat wider than yours although I should have enlarged it still more Preparatory to my flight however I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of intercourse and I therefore renounce the project altogether as too full of risk and danger
with this needle for the Abbey as opening his ragged vestments he Showdown tase a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remain Dennis
with what
and I had the edges over again
and was it not discover that your sheets
I tore up several of my shirts and ripped at the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment I finished well so that I have been able to finish my work here
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work
better shut this one up they put the stone back in its place be a they sprinkled a little dust over to conceal the traces of his having been removed robbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same parents as the other and then going towards his bed
I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulfur which was readily supplied Dante's laid the different things he'd been looking fat on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of fairy is mine
and matches
so sad The Abbey exhibit is a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illumination
I finished myself for the light
indeed they are not a God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural condition
why For Heaven's Sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark

one thing still puzzles me observe Dante's and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight
as for the ink I told you how I managed to obtain that and I only just make it from time to time as I require it
Dante's exam in the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the Curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseille as the works of the Savages in the South Seas from Wednesday had been brought by the different trading vessels
one could cut and thrust
oh yes said Faria the penknife
Dante's exam ended with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form
showing to the young man a slender stick about 6 inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen
look
now let me behold the Curious pins with what you have written your work
IC answer Dante
should I ever get out of prison and fined in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed my literary reputation is forever secure
I wrote the word Finney at the end of the 68th strip about a week ago
these worlds consisted of slips of cloth about 4 in wide and 18 long they were all carefully numbers and closely covered with writing so illegible the Dante's could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being an Italian
a c a b
I am anxious to see your Treasures yeah they smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel along Stone which had doubtless been the Earth beneath which was a cavity of considerable death serving as a safe depository of the Articles mention to Dante
appeared to him perfectly impossible each word that fell from his companions lips seemed Frost with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the minds of good rod and Golconda what you could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest you
well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes around the Sun then if I possess to watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun in Earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost abundantes who had always imagined
look at this Ray of Light which enters by my window so the Abbey and then observe the lines traced on the wall
instinctively Dante's turned around to observe by what watch or clock The Abbey have been able so accurately to specify the hour
it is well said the attic we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past 12
I see enter the Chamber of his friend Dante's cast around one eager and searching glands in quest of the expected Marvel's but nothing more than common met his View
the floor of the Abbey cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner of which Dante's had witnessed the completion
after having passed with tolerable is to the Subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor and they sell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permit at 1 to creep through on hands and knees

the whole assembly were done with astonishment at the Revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last Fortnight by the Parisian world
I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the proof cure who will succeed me and as he spoke these words or the horse choking voice he staggered toward the door which was mechanically open by a doorkeeper
I am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose
if Akira dropped his head his he started like those of a man under a violent attack a fever and yet he was deadly pale

gentleman I know I am in the hands of an avenging God

notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears in the madness which turned his brain for the Ford roses he perceived her
she was carried out of the hall the thick Veil which concealed her face dropped off and Madame danglars was recognized
I did not even wish to know her name nor do I know it just then a piercing cry and in the suburbs from the center of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent beneficiary
my mother thought me dead she is not guilty
as the president
but your mother
if I have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been said bitter and lamentable then Pity Me
that is why I've heard the word for what you blame me
one day when I curse Providence for making me so wicked and ordains me to such a fate to my adopted father said to me of your father who can find you to hell if you died and two misery of America preserve you alive
certainly I might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues
proceed said the president
that's you see though born in Paris I was brought up in Corsica there was a moment of silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the Stillness
7 3 months afterwards that woman travel from Wrigley anyhow to Paris to fetch me and having claims me as your son Carry Me Away
he was concealed in a Thicket you saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground

in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arms telling my mother I was dead
I will give them
do you wish for any further details
I know repeat that I was born as a tool on the night of the 27th of September 1817
but he said the irritated president you called yourself benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claim Corsica as your country
gentleman said Andre commanding Silence by his voice and manner I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said
All Eyes return for a moment towards the procure who said as motionless as though a thunderbolt it changed him into a corpse

they asked my age I tell it they ask my name I cannot give it since my parents abandon me
during the same channels Andre had turned his smiling face for the assembly then leaning with one hand on the open Trail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen I assure you I had no idea of insulting the core
and she had recovered
order was re-established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and Whisper to one another
in the midst of the cell most of the voice of the presidents was heard to exclaim and you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equaled encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy
the exclamations the insults address to benedetto Who Remain perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the Ginge arms the steers are the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in the case of any disturbance all this lasted 5 minutes before the doorkeepers and magistrates were able to restore silence

the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the Court both in the name of morality you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you had delayed acknowledgements your name
said the president
and now a prisoner will you consent to tell your name

accused said the president your name and surname Andre Rose
I'd like the reading of the indictment was ended
Andre paid no attention to the success of charges which were brought against him and who no doubt practice upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain Endeavor to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze
cure  Bernadette was last forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced
the crime was depicted in the most Vivid colors his transformation a review of his life for the earliest. We're set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life with furnished to a mind like that

divers descended and machines made expressly on the Discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of 10/3 only remained the rest having been broken by the waves
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars

it is the work of another age constructed by the gini of earth and water
it seems to me said danglars in his corstone ill-concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough
you see my position Madam said moral bestowing a grateful smile and Montecristo
Madame danglars through a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Montecristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slightly motion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to Morrell sir I should ask you if you would sell your horse  Morel Smiles with an expression for like a Grimace and then turned around to Monte Cristo
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage
nothing escaped the couch notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame danglars to that of The Minister's secretary
The Carriage drove around and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen
and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses a cup divided by two mounted gentleman arrived at the gate which open before then

elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars nick-nacks
when chamber alone had been respected by the Magnificent Patricia
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in China jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvelous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the clock
the servants past Gailey along with fine Courtyard some belonging to the kitchens glided down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabit at the house others feeling the coach houses where the equipment is encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last 50 years
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life with scented with its Masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to His Wish when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls
Patricia made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantel pieces with flowers
the overseer would not have ejected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it and circled as it was by a framework of trees
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to bertucio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones
there's nothing now to prevent my building myself a little Hut on my Plantation and residing not 20 yards from you

I have chosen a trade  betrayed

at one corner where the foliage became so thick has almost to shut out day a large Stone bench and Sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular used by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it those situated but a hundred Paces off
towards the house to Chestnut trees we have before mentioned Rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the Boon of light and air
a small load or gave egress from the wild space we have been describing into the projected Street the ground having been abandoned does unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation has to return not even the one half percent it originally paid
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interest us has but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no ground for apprehending that Advantage would be taken of that circumstance
and so as we have said the Iron Gate leading into the kitchen-garden have been closed up and left to the rust which paid Fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers in delvers of the ground from presuming to Sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate have been boarded up to a height of 6 ft
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron played but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that I handsome some might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line at the proposed Street and so making it a branch of communication with a faubourg saint-honore itself one of the most important their Affairs in the city of Paris
for the demon of speculation drew a line or another words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen Garden
as they wave their variegated leaves in the wind and Charmed the eye with their Scarlet bloom had fallen into other disuse  the Proprietors of the Mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its Stickley planted Courtyard opening into the faubourg saint on or end to the Garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen Garden of about an acre
and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses by with each other for Elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large card with the wide spreading Chestnut trees raise their heads high above the walls in a solid Rampart and with the coming of Every Spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms in the large Stone bases that stood upon the two square pillows stirs of a curiously wrought iron gate
and now Rosa go
and with a trembling hand Cornelius wrote the address to mine here Peter Van systems burgomaster and president of the Horticultural Society of Harlow
oh he's very well known it is mine Hannah van systens the burgomaster of Harlem give it to me Rosa give it to me
give me the letter I will direct it

they will then know how the Tulip has been grown how much care and anxiety and how many sleepless nights it has cost but for the present not a minute must be lost the messenger

I could not have written it with such beautiful simplicity
your letter is admirable
that's get DeRosa that's it
I have the honor to be your humble servant Rosa crisis
it is opened it is perfectly Black come when you're president come
it is my wish that it should be called rose up are they in
this is the reason why I beg you to come and touch yourself
I cannot therefore bring to you this wonderful flower
I am the daughter of the Jailer typhus almost as much of a captive as the prisoners of my father
as soon as it is open I shall send a messenger to you with a request that you will come and fetch it in person from The Fortress at Lotus Thai
Cornelius took the letter and read in a handwriting as follows mine here president the black tulip is about to open perhaps in 10 minutes
here is the letter and tell me whether you approve of it
watch the Tulip opened I wrote it myself for I did not wish to lose a moment
is it windy
it is written my dearest Cornelius said Rosa
Rosa said Cornelius almost gasping Rosa there is not one moment to lose in writing the letter
the whole of the flower with his black and Shining as jet
my God my God. Just reward me for my innocence in my captivity has now has to love to such flowers

Cornelius utter to cry and was nearly fainting
boss with the other she held to the same height the miraculous to
Cornelius started with one spring from the window to the door his lips met those of Rosa who told him with a kiss it is open it is black here it is
nearly at that very moment the prisoner heard in the lobby and the wrestling of a gown and a well-known voice which said to him Cornelius my friend and very happy friend come come quickly
he said here is heaven sending a song to my flower

at this moment a star blast in the southern sky and shot through the whole Horizon falling down as it were on the Fortress of love
yes perhaps at this moment the two objects of my dearest love caress each other under the eye of Heaven
down there he said this Rosa watching like myself and waiting from minute to minute down there under roses eyes is the mysterious flower which lives which expands which opens
but today this evening and tonight again I see thee in all thy wondrous glory in the mirror of the Heavenly Abode and more clearly still
oh Thou Art always watching from on high my God he cried have prostrate his glowing eyes fixed upon the Stars forgive me that I almost doubted the existence during these latter days for thou didst hide my face behind the clouds and work for a moment lost my sight oh thou merciful god that pitying father Everlasting
he fills his lungs with a pure sweet air while his brain dwelt upon thoughts of happiness and is hard overflowed with gratitude and religious fervor
he was fairly choking with happiness and joy he opened his window and gaze long with swelling heart at the cloudless Vault of Heaven and the moon which Shone like silver upon the two-fold stream flowing from far beyond the Hills
Cornelius stood with his heart upon his lips in his face glued to the Wicker in the door
rosette made her Escape
the prisoners prayer and identify ecstasy his lips met those at the maiden not by chance nor by stratagem what is Sam Cruz was to meet the lips of Julie 100 years later

Omarosa given me of your own free will and not by chance
your cheek your fresh cheek your soft rosy cheeks
and that is
and now that you have said very dear DeRosa say also most happy say happier and more blessed than ever man was under the sun
very dear yes very dear citrosa with a beating heart beyond yourself with happiness
very dear friend I entreat you say very dear Rosa very dear
my friend

compare me to the black tulip and I promise you
Rosa Rosa I don't know to what Wonder Under the Sun I should compare you
Rosa side without any better feeling but rather like a woman who begins to understand affordable and to accustom herself to it
yes I understand
ended up Rising you
Omarosa whenever it opens remember that not a moment must be lost in a prizing the president
well
and if on your return you find it open
would indeed be quite capable of playing such a trick Sid Rosa
if we had been able to carry it ourselves Rosa it would never have left my hands but the passing to yours but this is a dream which we must not entertain continue Cornelius with a sigh

and entrust the Tulip to him
well let us suppose that he carries one day or even two but it is impossible to look fancy or like him will not tarry one hour not one minute not one sec
but if you Tarry
you write to the president of the Horticultural Society and I am sure he will come
be quiet so throws a smiling he is still under age as you have yourself fixed it from 26 to twin
one for whom I will answer he is one of my lovers
is he safe
if it is no more than that I have a messenger quite ready
my dear Rosa I've been dreaming all night in the first place of you Rosa made a sign of increase
could have been
without one spec
without a speck of any other color
black as jet
and will it flower black
this night without any doubt our tulip will be in flower
well what's going on prosperous
ask Cornelius
well
night came and with it Rosa joyous and cheerful as a bird
they passed us tonight
they came without any news that you look was not yet in flower
how Cornelius would have spurned the offer of his Liberty in exchange for his Chula
what would the world say when it heard that the black tulip was found that it existed and that it was the prisoner fun Barrel who had found it
Rosa no doubt I would be watching too but happier than he she watched over the Tulip she had before her eyes that Noble flower that Wonder of Wonders which Not only was I know but was not even possible until then
chapter 22 the opening of the flower the night passed away very sweetly for Cornelius although in great agitation
we have to confess to the disgrace of our hero and a floriculture that of his to affections he felt most strongly inclined to regret the loss of rose
perhaps she would never return to see the prisoner and then he would have no more news either of Rosa or of his tulips
Rosa was vexed with him and with good reason
what do you see
I see one thing
ask Cornelius
what is it
she said
Allah
Roosevelt her heart sank within her and her eyes were filled with tears
me who have no one in the world but you sacrificed me don't come to see me anymore
Bez mine here Cornelius said Rosa with a sweet mixture of melancholy and gravity vez your wishes are commands to me
no Rosa no tomorrow we shall come to a conclusion you will plant it according to my instructions and as to the third sucker Cornelius here heaved a deep sigh watch over it as a miser over his first or last piece of gold as the mother over her child as the wounded over the last drop of blood in his face
if I'd us give up the only and Last Resorts which we possess to the uncertain chances of the bad passions of anger and envy I should never deserve to be forgiven
acquired it last with a stoicism of a Roman of old it would be a weakness it would be Folly it would be a meanness
no
Cornelius reflected for a moment he evidently was struggling against some vehement desire
she pronounce these words with a smile which was not altogether without a tinge of irony
you are depriving yourself as I can easily see of a very great pleasure
well that is true but only think
yes that would do very well said Cornelius knitting his brow if your father were alone who watches all our ways
except two or three and along with them you make Row the Third sucker
indeed he did
tulip bulbs by the hundreds
which proposition
will you accept the proposition of my father

no just hear me I said Rosa will you try something else
to tell the truth set the prisoner signing likewise since your father crushed that unfortunate bulb I feel as if part of my own self as been paralyzed
tewodros with a sigh you are very fond of your bolts

we shall do as he does
well
feigned put the bulb into the ground leave the garden but look through the keyhole of the door and watch him
go tomorrow into the garden manage matters so that Jacob may know as he did the first time that you are going there and that he may follow you
so it would be very easy
in what manner
will you make sure of it
and yet it is very possible Sid Rosa
he was after my bolt and is in love with my tulip
with whom else
it is not you that he was in love with
who else died
it was not you he was after
well
Rosa said Cornelius growing quite paid
not one indeed
not one of your movements Escape 2
thick cornea
aloha aloha
I'm taking down under some pretext or other and I will search his cell in the meanwhile
the word certainly struck me
did you say that I have three
Cornelius
3 sucker
you need only search his person and if he has the other bulbs we shall find them as there usually are three suckers
how so
Jacob said my father it would not be so difficult to ascertain that
but I was kept by something which I heard although it was uttered in a very low voice only
I shrug my shoulders turn my back and Advance toward the door
some little show of anger sometimes Satan answer
it was as if he had tried to read my thoughts at the bottom of my heart
I turned my eyes away to avoid my father's look but I met those of Jacob
I only know as unfortunately it is our lot to live with prisoners that for them any Pastime is a value
I said negligently do I understand anything of tulips
what do I know
I saw that I had made a blunder
so then my pretty Rosa he said
at these words if I must say it his eyes seem to flash like lightning
ask Cornelius
what did Jacob say or do it these words
perhaps some less precious one than that was I quite and cautiously reply
you may buy a hundred of them in the market of cork
cried my father what a man's Misfortune is it to question 2 above
well now are you mad
fortunately
I did not know what to answer as you had so strictly enjoying me never to allow anyone to guess the interest which you are taking in the bowl
then turning towards me he continued asking and what did that poor young man say
call Jacob taking my father by the collar but he immediately lose to
you will search for the others
very well we shall search for the others
set my father
you think it was not the only one
inquired Cornelius with some anxiety
did he ask that
then turning toward me he asked but it was not the only one that he had
my God my God crushed
he asked his friend
are you mad too
my father was quite dumbfounded
you have committed a great crime
it is Infamous set master Jacob it is odious
indeed I have
you have done that he cried you have crushed the ball
I really thought he would set fire to the castle his eyes were like two flaming torches his hair stood on end and a clenched fist for a moment
continue Frozen
had you only seen Master Jacob at that moment
Cornelius heaved a sigh which might have been called a grown
well being asked by his friend my father told it's supper the whole story of the Tulip or rather of the bulb and of his own Define exploit of crushing it
that's the prisoner
how was
famous she smiled in such a way that the little cloud of jealousy which I darken the brow of Cornelius speedily vanished
all master Jake
The Prisoner asked with a doleful look
how do you know that
that hints for her father would make no objection to his cultivating flowers
it is me you have trodden Under Foot
Cornelius that slept alone with his bitter grief muttered to himself you old hangman
Master Jacob Crossing

do you hear father said Rosa
Rose's lover Rosa had scarcely pronounce these consult or e words what a voice was heard from the staircase asking caifas how Masters were going on

while receiving the thinks of our friend
West walking about in the gallery from the door to the window from the window to the door but at the moment he was going to ascertain if it were he the Usher summoned him to his Majesty's presence

my friend the pleasures to which we are not accustomed a process more than the Greeks with which we are familiar
said he you are rich and not gay you who were so anxious for well
how is this
and found him so thoughtful that he could not help expressing his surprise
and he returned home at full speed nobody had yet touched his treasure
I will think of it said he thank you sir
ask the 1500 leaf that would be paying too dear for what a little vigilance would procure him or nothing
a fortnite was delaying up to allow the thieves of London time to remove all occasion for the strongbox
Dalton Hills brow darker

downtown you shut himself up ain't no dinner close to store to everybody and with a lighted lamp and a loaded pistol on the table

he had the bags packed in a small cart and returned home meditating deeply
these words made a thousand cords vibrate in the heart. Send you which he had never felt before
your money
then impassable and Justice flight as he ought to be towards man honored with a friendship of the king he said the. Sanyal take away your money sir
the treasure replaced all the rules in bags and clothes each bag with a stamp sealed with the arms of England a favor which treasurer's do not Grant to everybody
that's in your easily controlled himself and yet on this occasion he could not help even sing a joy which the reader will perhaps comprehend if he deigns to have some indulgences for a man who since his birth had never seen so many pieces and roles of pieces juxta place in an order truly agreeable to the eye
he had then the satisfaction to exchange a piece of paper covered with very ugly writing for a prodigious number of crowns recently stamped with the effigies
chapter 34 of the embarrassment of riches. Daniel lost no time and as soon as the thing was suitable and opportune he paid a visit to the Lord treasurer of his majesty
I shall consider of it
I stand of Austria once more
do you accept
thank you Monsieur fouquet said he just missing the superintendent civil
thank you mother replied Louis Dowling respectfully to the queen
as long as a king lives he has no other measure about his conscience no other judge than his own desires but when dead he has posterity which applauds or accuse
refuse sire set 4K
nonsense except my son except said Annabelle Austria you are above reports and interpretation
for them or his majesty has asked my opinion I have given it if his majesty asked my concurrence it will be the same
and were they not oppressed Madame replied through K when they were made to sweat the Forty Millions given by this deed
yes by pressing the people said the queen
the king shall have them whenever he wishes said the superintendent to finances balance
it is precisely Madame because these forty Millions would be a fortune that I will say to the king sorry if it be not decent for a king to accept from a subject six horses it'll becomes you miss your to give your King on lesson said Annabelle stria better procure for him forty Millions to replace those you make him lose
but Monsieur said of Austria instead of persuading the king not to receive this present or calling to his Majesty's mind you whose Duty it is that these forty millions are Fortune to him
set an apostrophe in the same tone as that in which at a later. For Marie Antoinette replied you will tell me as much  I know said 4K laughing 40 Millions makes a good round sum
what's 40 million
the king remained silent between these two contrary opinion
you have yourself said why Madame replied 4K because Kings cannot a knock-knock to receive presents from their subjects

and why not
but do not accept continued 4K
said the queen
thank him sir
accepting and thank him and sister date of Austria
got the present is worth the trouble yes Madam said 2k with the lofty are that did not escape the king
then turning towards bouquet  it's not that likewise your opinion miss you
well reply to Adam Austria it seems to me my son that a man who has just made such a present has a good right to expect to be thanked for it with some degree of Chrome
set the young king was evident repugnance

right then sire
why it is but an hour since I left his Eminence said the king
the superintendent only bestowed a haughty look of a second upon it then ballet
the king looked at him and held the paper out to him and turn
bouquet had taken some steps backwards and remain silent
this is very Noble on the part of his Eminence and will silence all malicious rumors  40 million scrape together slowly coming back all-in-one heat to the treasury it is the act of a faithful subject and a good Christian
oh my son
40 Millions by the queen
repeat
a gift
irregularly drawn up deed of gift said she

and of Austria red and turn and Ashley red her eyes sparkled with joy all the greater from her useless Endeavor to hide it which attracted the attention of bouquet
read said the king passing the parchment to his mother as if you thought that nothing less than reading would convince Adam Austria the things so astonishing as was conveyed in that paper
is he worse than
what is the matter my son
atlinks he glanced upon it and other two faint cry reading the first line
during the speech Louie was unconsciously folding and unfolding measure ends paper upon which he had not cast his eyes
but the king is silent and consequently I am condemned
his majesty by accepting the gift of these six incomparable horses would stimulate the pride of his own breeders of limousine and the simulation would have been beneficial to all
under the mild heat of this luxury of Kings Springs the luxury of individuals a source of riches for the people
with luxury a king nourishes his subjects and honors them
bouquet darted a hottie glance at the queen mother who appeared to Tryon for the false position in which the minister had placed himself and replied luxury is the virtue of Kings sire It Is by luxury they are more than other men
I am not able then however willing I may be to purchase such a valuable set of horses
thank you Monsieur fouquet said the king politely and I am gratified by your intention for I love good horses but you know I am not very rich you who are my superintendent of finances know it better than anyone else
it was not so much a present that I committed myself to offer as the tribute I pay
I hope Madame set 2K much agitated that my love for his majesty
you know miss you if UK said the queen that at the court of France it is not the custom for a subject to offer anything to his King
the king became quite red
true they knock me down there for the horses only awaits the orders of his Majesty's into the Royal stables and if I allowed myself to try them it was only for fear of offering to the king anything that was not positively wonderful
that's my damn he probably said
but 2K caught her song
the Queen Mother smiled with something like secret Envy
your majesty sees I have not been cheating
I received from England three pairs of very fast horses as I have been assured they were placed a distance of 4 leagues apart and I tried them this evening
I understand you sorry your majesty doubts my word and you have reason to do so but I've really come in that time though it is wonderful
said the King still able to restrain his anger but not to conceal his astonishment
an hour and a half
an hour and a half ago yes your majesty said fouque Consulting a watch richly ornamented with diamonds
and the affair seems so pressing that I left at once
yes I are I know that said who came in fact he is very low
you know Monsieur fouquet said Louis
he turned half round therefore and will continue in his conversation with the queen Face To The King
Louis had opened the paper and yet he did not read it
bouquet perceived this movement and with the politeness at 1zz and respectful Advanced towards the queen so as not to disturb the king
he nodded their for familiarly to fouque whilst he continue to unfold a paper given to him by the Usher
well saying these words a better feeling gave to these words of the queen I most hateful expression whereas the brow of the king calm and self-possessed on the contrary was without the slightest wrinkle
he is only a man who is much too rich that is all
in addition to all this allowed murmur Was Heard along his Passage
it was he who made the noise in the antechamber and it was his horse that made the noise in the courtyard
as he spoke with thought this the door opened and the superintendent of finances fouque appeared before his nominal master
I was mistaken there are two
how could I say there was but one king in front
haha
but at the moment he was about to open it there was a great noise in the gallery the antechamber and the core
give it to me said the king and he took the paper
what's the Usher
ask the king
what have you there
the king had scarcely see speaking when an usher looked at the tapestry and stood with a paper in his hand waiting for the king to speak to him
yes Madam yes certainly it would be a great loss for the kingdom said Luigi coloring  but the Peril does not seem to me to be so great besides the Cardinal is still young
said the queen
it's not that your opinion as well as mine my son
yes Madam said the king  and it would be a great loss to the kingdom of God were to summon his Eminence away
perhaps the alteration was caused by the cancer which should be done to consume her breast
the face of an of Austria. A little changed but that was from sufferings of quite a personal character
I have absolutely nothing my son  only you cannot have failed to remark that his Eminence the Cardinal is very ill  Louis looked at his mother expecting some emotion in her voice some sorrow in her countenance
Adam said he looking earnestly at his mother  one would almost say in truth that you had something else to announce to me
Louis listen with increased attention to the words which end of Austria no doubt pronounced with a view to consult him
it results therefore that the young gather the Abundant Harvest prepared for them by the old
besides continued and of Austria the Lord never gives the goods of this world but for a season the Lord as correctives to honor and riches the Lord has placed sufferings sickness and death and no one had achieved with a Melancholy smile which proved she made the application of the funeral precept to herself no man can take his wealth a greatness with him to the Grave
God forbid Madonna that I should ever approach my mother with anything
that is what I mean to say by the words for which you reproach me
no said the queen warmly no sire they who are rich in this age under your Reign are rich because you have been willing they should be so and I entertain against them neither malice nor Envy they have without doubt so if your majesty sufficiently well for your majesty to have permitted them to reward themselves
a day will come and perhaps quickly we're on you will have occasion to remember that Axiom and they alone are Kings who are all-powerful  your intention continue to King was not however to cast blame upon the Richmond of this age was it
my son reply dad about Austria shaking her head  you are wrong not to trust my word you are wrong not to grant me your confidence
I thought I was under the federal of my professor and developing a subject of amplification
what were you doing
I only paid attention to one thing my son and that was that you were complaining
the king started an advance towards her  I hope said he your majesty has paid no attention to the vein declamations which the Solitude and discussed familiar to King's suggest to the happiest disposition
The Voice which it pronounce these words was that of Anne of Austria
Louis turned around sharply
because set up voice replying to his and which sounded from the other side of the door of the cabinet  because of the Palais Royale lies all the gold that is to say all the power of him who desires to rain
have not I the king the right to ask if you all that
why my good God
I know there were not 20 anxious to see the king of France they're not even 10 archers to guard my Palace of residence archers people guards all are at the Palais Royal
20 what do I say
I have just returned to my Louvre my horses just on harnessed are still smoking and I have created interest enough to induce scarcely 20 persons to look at me as I pass
people of France
what a title
he struck his brow with his open hand crying King of France
then passing his hand over his brow and feeling the one to bear
when was I'll be able to open for any purpose but to Psy or smile lips condemned to the motionless stupidity of the marbles in the gallery
the young king then was as we have seen a pray to a double excitement and he said to himself as he looked at a glass  O'Kane King by name and not in fact Phantom veins phantom art thou and art statue which has no other power than that of provoking salutations from courtier when wilt thou be able to raise dye velvet are more clinched I still can have
understood at once that the Cardinal must be very ill  scarcely had an of Austria conducted the young Queen to her apartments and taken from her brows a headdress of ceremony when she went to see her son and his cabinet We're Alone Melancholy and depressed he was indulging as if to exercise his will and one of those terrible in word passions King's passions which create events when they break out became such benign Tempest that his most violent his only passion was that famous fit of anger which she exhibited 50 years later on the occasion of a little concealment of the Duke demands and which had four result a shower of blows inflicted with a cane upon the back of a poor valet who had stolen A Biscuit
courtiers have a marvelous and sting consenting the turn of events courtiers possesses Supreme kind of science their diploma tests and throwing light upon the unraveling of complicated entry captains and dividing the issue of battles and positions in curing the sick
and the tide of flattery was mounting towards the throne
Colbert resumed his place at masserants pillow at the first interval of pain and persuaded him to dictate a donation that's conceived  about to appear before God the master of mankind I beg the king who was my master on Earth to resume the wealth which is bounty has bestowed upon me and which my family would be happy to see passenger such an illustrious hands
it would appear as if all the cries of the Cardinal and all the attacks of death upon this representative of the past or stimulants for the genius of this thinker with the bushy eyebrows who was turning already towards the rising sign of a regenerated Society
whilst burning hot napkins fizik revolves and you know who was recalled or performing their functions with increased activity holding his great head and both his hands to compress with in at the feed store in the projects engendered by the brain was meditating the tenor of the donation he would make meth around right
his neck stretched out his lips half open to give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent thoughts he lashed up his courage to the pitch of the undertaking contemplated whilst within ten Paces up him separated only by a wall his master was being stifled by anguish which Drew for him lamentable cries thinking no more of the Treasures of the Earth or of the joys of paradise but much of all the horrors of hell
the Cardinal was indeed very ill  large drops of sweat flow down upon his bed of Agony and the frightful power of a face streaming with water was a spectacle which the most hardened practitioner could not have be held without much compassion
I'm very very ill Colbert  I am near my end
but see you if he does not accept I should like to guarantee my 13 Reserve Millions to him yes I will do so yes
and I am neither the one nor the other my Lord you appear to be much afraid that the king will accept you have a deal more reason to fear that he will not accept
but then you would be either a fool or a traitor
then they would remain 13 Millions for your family and that is a good round sum
but if he should accept it if he should even think of accepting it
your donation my Lord
alright cool. Are you alright go and seek the King on my part and take him my will
nobody will afterwards be able to accuse your eminence of that unjust avarice with which pamphleteers ever approached the most brilliant mind of the present age
an enormous one
I will write them if my Lord will have the goodness to dictate them
but those things what are they
and you will guarantee that if I give my 40 Millions to the king saying certain things to him at the same time I guarantee he will refuse.
all that does not proceed from himself I predict he will distain
this Prince will send you nor with the Palais mazarin which you have had so superbly constructed nor with the senator Matt where he was born
a young man who is yet done nothing who burns to distinguish himself who burns to rain alone will never take anything ready built he will construct for himself
exactly it's a donation were made in a certain form he would refuse it
I would prevent him
triple fool that I am
two and a half hours yes Colbert yes he is anxious for my death in order to inherit
a young man who is anxious for my death my Lord
just so
why didn't he a young man and devoured by ambition
because the king will not accept as a whole
said mazarin quite the wheels
about for what
well my Lord if I have Divine Right Lee your eminence has but to give all your money to the king and that immediately
next
Pride yes you are right
pardon me my Lord haughtiness nobleness Kings have no Pride that is a human patch
Pride
airtime  go on that is
that character if I may venture to express myself does resembles that which my Lord confessed just now to
that is because your eminence absorbed as you are by your disease
you said so clearly it seems to me when you advised me to get it to him
cried mazarin ironically and from whom at the same time the gout forced painful moans
then you would have me throw all my money into the coffers of the king
I am ignorant of nothing my Lord during 10 years All The Columns of figures which are found in France have passed interview before me and if I have painfully nail them into my brain I could recite figure by figure all the money that is spent in France from Marseille to show
yes but you are ignorant of the principles details of the question
I thought your eminence did me the honor to ask my advice
leaving a part to his majesty is to a valve that that part has inspired you with doubt that's the lawfulness of the means of acquisition
the legacy of a part would dishonor you and offend the king
his majesty said he between his teeth your money most senior would afford him a delicious banquet
cold air but his lips at the name of Phuket
that is not my Affair said masserant triumphantly whose accounts I gave you to verify some months ago
your eminence is too skillful politician not to know that at this moment
to make restitution of a part that is to say his Majesty's part and that most in you may have its dangers
do you not dream of such a thing you speak just as the Confessor did
cried mess around with Great War
in which case my Lord I should consider you as required by the Taya 10-2 to make restitution
that is possible
he believed your eminence to be at death's door because your eminence consulted him did I not hear him say a recollect my Lord if he did not say something a little like that to you  that is quite a theatrical speech
oh no a snare what for
my Lord interrupted him I think it would be quite as well to examine whether wasn't a attend said is not a snare
Colbert resumed his pedantic look
I felt assured that in Consulting you cold air I should have put advice replied mazarin greatly delighted
I see no impediment to that much
and I might fairly keep for my own family which is so needy a good fortune the whole even of which I have iron
that is beyond doubt
then I have received a merely legitimate salary in spite of the opinion of my Confessor
does it
admits of no contradiction my Lord
as if I had not saved both his State and his finances
mother and Shrugged his shoulders
against the king
that is true my Lord
in the first place they commit the wrong of dying
true late and yet it is very possible that according to his theological views no evidence has been in a certain degree in the wrong
recycle.
all this money be badly acquired
can he be right
yes my Lord
Alaska
said mazarin
have you heard
Colbert reappeared beneath the curtains
in the midst of the general silence a voice became Audible
when one has the honor of being an expert his master is one mustn't let himself open to call Satan have time to complete the complement
how true
well then it will serve Master right
it must be sad clown say
and mustard be said
to be sure, Sara pied serenely I just think they'll have fun at Masters expense
and it would have attracted every curiosity Seeker in town
in Masters little apartment conseil answered in Masters Museum
$1,000 if Master will permit my saying so, say replied I never expected to win that prize
perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history
at least so I thought
observing home say I discovered that just barely the Gallant lad have fallen under the general influence
then all traces of light vanished into the darkness
sometimes the murky ocean Sparkle beneath moonbeans the darted between the fringes of two clouds
officers were probing increasing Gloom with her night glasses
roosting in the shrouds the crew examine the Horizon which shrink and darkened little by little
konsei station beside me stared straight ahead
just then I was in the bowel leaning over the starboard rail
the sea undulated possibly Bonita frigates tempos
huge cloud cover the moon's disk then and its first quarter
8 and just dropped
night was coming on
the shores of Japan were less than 200 miles Charlie word
for the evening of November 4th arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved
all the Abraham Lincoln key to its longboats radiated and every direction around it and didn't leave a single point of the sea unexplored
enormous size of bacon we're trails in our wake to the great satisfaction I must say of assorted sharks
1000 methods were used to spark his interest or Rouse it from his apathy
the Abraham Lincoln stayed at half Steam
2 days past
a supreme challenge I've been issued to the giant narwhal and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this summons to appear
spy glasses function with feverish energy
each man wanted one last look with which to some of his experience
the ocean was observed with renewed care
and had the immediate effect of Reviving The Cruise failing spirits
This Promise was given on November 2nd
and Abraham Lincoln which are Decor store European Seas
I'm unwilling to say that there was Mutiny on board
a sailor's couldn't hide their discontent and their work suffer because of it
the commander stood his ground
I requested this effect was presented to the commander
never had the crew of an American Naval craft show more patients and zeal
this reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship from the quarters of the bunker hands to the mess room of the general staff and for certain if it hadn't been for Commander farragut's characteristics stubbornness forget what ultimately it put back to that cape in the south
inevitably the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents
the typical human fickleness they jumped from one extreme to the other
and each man now Wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrifice
nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhal or an underwater I'll
nothing except an immense message is hurted waves
and we found nothing
for 3 months during which each day seems like a century the Abraham Lincoln plowed all the Northerly Seas of the Pacific Racing after whale sighted abruptly veering off-course swerving sharply from one task to another stopping suddenly putting on Steam and reversing engines in quick succession at the risk of stripping its gears and it didn't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coast of America
and this reaction wasn't long in coming
20 times a day some error in perception or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees would cause intolerable anguish and this emotion repeated 20 times over kept in the state of irritability so intense the reaction was bound to follow
nobody ain't nobody slap
Hearts were pounding hideously
and in all honesty shipboard conditions became life threatening
you're finally in the area of the monsters latest antics
then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132 degrees and headed for the Seas of China
Commander Farragut felt and with good reason that it was best to stay in deep Waters and keep his distance from continents or Islands no doubt or Bose inside because there isn't enough water for him
these bearings determined the frigate took a more decisive Westward heading and tackle the Seas of the Central Pacific
now Professor you know even better than I that nature doesn't violate good sense
it's blessed with a terrific gift for getting around
people say they sighted the slippery Beast again in the Pacific high seas I'm truly willing to believe it but two months of already gone by since then and judging by your narwhals personality it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways
can you see we're just wondering around at random
he replied nothing's out there professor aronnax and if there is some animal what chance would we have spotting it
concern
a hundred times I chided him for his
the stubborn Canadian spend eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin
Ned land still kept up the most Tanisha skepticism
by then it was the Bad season in the southernmost regions because July in this Zone corresponds to our January in Europe but the sea remain smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter
our Voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions
however the weather held good
the Abraham Lincoln would change course and race I should animals cited only to find an ordinary baleen whale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid A Chorus of curses
but what a waste of energy
I stared I scared until I nearly went blind from a worn-out retina well, say a stoic has ever kept repeating to me in a calm Tone If Master's eyes will kindly stop bulging Master will see farther
with panting chest and anxious eyes we each would observe the cetaceans movements
the cows over the companion ways would vomit a torrent of sailors and officers
in an instant the frigates deck would become densely populated
SunRail and how many times I share the excitement of general staff and crew in some unpredictable whale lifted his blackish back above the waves
sometimes bending over The Forecastle railings sometimes leaning against the
I no longer left the ship's deck
day and night we observe the surface of the ocean and those with Nick tilapia guys whose ability to see in the dark increase their chances by 50%
eyes and spy glasses a bit Dazzle just true but Avista of $2,000 didn't remain at rest for an instant
and they opened amazingly why
repeated the sailors of the Abraham Lincoln
open your eyes
open your eyes
our course was set for the Northwest and the next day our frigates propeller finally turn the Waters of the Pacific
near 3 in the afternoon on July 6th 15 miles south of shore the Abraham Lincoln double that solitary eyelid at the tip of the South American continent that stray Rock Dutch team in her name is Cape Horn after their hometown of Warren
Miiverse Taylor swore the monster couldn't negotiate this passageway simply because he's too big for it
indeed where we likely to encounter the Narwhal in such a cramp straight
the crew sided with him unanimously
and maneuvered instead to double Cape Horn
by July 3rd we were at the entrance to the Strait of Magellan a breast of Cabo de lis Virginia
the frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with prodigious speed
assuredly the monster ever had to deal with Ned land's Harpoon I wouldn't bet on the monster
and the Canadian have such good luck that with the right and left shot he Harpoon not one well but to striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes Chase
anxious to see Ned land at work Commander Farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the Monroe
but one of them the captain of the Monroe
off the Falkland Islands on June 30th the frigate came in contact with a fleet of American Whalers and we learned that they hadn't seen in our
the one circumstance arose that displayed Ned land's marvelous skills and show just how much confidence we could place in him
for some wild Voyage of Abraham Lincoln was marked by no incident
is 39 stars gleaned from The Gap of the mizzen sail it how did Judas and covered strip of land were thousands of Spectators that claimed us one more time
the wonderful right Bank of this River all loaded down with country homes and pass by the forts to solutes from their biggest cannon
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving about these tightly packed masses hailing Abraham Lincoln until it reached the Waters of Hudson River and the shape of the long Peninsula that forms New York City
departing from 500,000 throats three cheers burst forth in succession
the wars of Brooklyn and every part of New York bordering East River or crowded with curiosity Seekers
the blades of the propeller turn the Waze with increasing speed and the Abraham Lincoln moved out majestically into spectator laid an escort of some 100 fairies and tenders  author's note tenders are small steamboats that assist the big liners
long horizontal Pistons ground and push the tie rods at the drive shaft
steam rust whistling into the gaping valves
a disorder which was related to the engine by means of the compressed air device the mechanics activated the startup wheel
but Commander Farragut didn't want to waste a single day
and so if I've been delayed by quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and I would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable Expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
Justin Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last Moorings holding Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn Pier
with all due respect to master call Sarah plaid as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a well
I was well satisfied with my cabin which is located in the stern and opened into the officers mess
the frigates interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues
I doubt and letting the commander attend to getting underway I was taken to the cabin that have been set aside for me
your cabin is waiting for you
welcome aboard professor
in person
tomato Farragut
the same I replied
he said to me
Professor Pierre aronnax
one of the sailors led me to the Afterdeck where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking officer who extended his hand to me
I asked for Commander Farragut
I rushed born
that great New York Annex located on the Left Bank of the East River in a few minutes we arrived at the Wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting Torrance of black smoke from its two funnels
professor of 20 francs the vehicle went on Broadway to Union Square
I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris France
I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor
the hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine
cuz they did them in a Flash and I was sure the lad had missed a thing because he classified shirts and Suits as expertly as birds and mammals
a quarter of an hour later our trunks were ready
what Master does Isle du conseil reply
we have a commander whose game for anything
but we're going just the same
these bees can be quite unpredictable
it's a glorious Mission but also a dangerous one

we're going to rid the Seas of it
you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious Nar

oh it's nothing really

certainly I reply to face if we put after we make a detour

we'll deal with him later
how to say venture to observe
what about Masters collection
pack as much into my trunk if you can my traveling kit my suit shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
we haven't a moment to lose
as Master wishes, say replied serenely
we're departing in 2 hours
get my things ready get yours ready
yes my boy
call say it.
I called a third time
call Sarah
there is good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
to be sure I had confidence in this devoted lad
I repeated well feverishly beginning my preparations for departure
call Sarah
he was a fanatic on formality as he only address me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome
but conseil had one flaw
please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting I had turned 40
the lad was 30 years old and his age. If his employer was as 15 is to 20
moreover he enjoyed excellent Health that defied all ailments own solid muscles but hadn't a nerve in him not a sign of nerves the mental type I mean
he went Here There and Everywhere and perfect contentment
never did he have Jack to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever China or the Congo no matter how far off it was
not once did he comment on the length of the hardships of the journey
for the past 10 years, say had gone would be wherever science back in
and yet what a fine Gallant lad
well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly Versed and its practical application and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale
classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else
but they're his science came to a halt
and can I say I had a season specialist in biological classification and enthusiastic you could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches groups classes subclasses orders families Genera subgenero species and varieties
from rubbing shoulders with scientists and our little Universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
a devoted lad who went with me on all my Journeys a gallon Flemish boy am I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment a born stoic punctilious on principle habitually hard-working really startled by like surprises very skillful with his hands efficient and his every Duty and despite his having a name that means Council never giving advice not even the unsolicited kind
call stay with my manservant
I called in an impatient voice
that fine animal may even let itself be captured in European Seas as a personal favor to me, I say
besides I'm used all roads lead home to Europe and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me to the coast of France
I forgot everything else in without another thought of exhaustion friends or collections I accepted the American government's offer
but now nothing could hold me back
I wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
even so I had just returned from an arduous Journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
I understood last of my true vocation my sole purpose in life was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it
chapter 3 as Master wishes 3 seconds before the arrival of JB Hobson's letter
half a day's delay would have been Unforgivable
the cast off he needed only to Fire and Stoke is furnaces
not a crewman was missing from his post
is coal bunkers were overflowing
is Provisions were loaded on board
not even a 24-hour breather was granted to Commander Farragut
this news caused intense excitement
in a patient screw until on June 2nd where it came at the Tampico a steamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai had cited the animal again 3 weeks before in the northern Seas of the Pacific
so the forget was equipped for Farah voyage and arms with fearsome fishing gear but nobody knew where to steer it
accordingly the Wags claimed that the slippery Rascal had waylaid some passing Telegram and was making the most of it
people are constantly babbling about the creature even via the Atlantic Cable
apparently the Unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around
not a single ship encountered it
for two months nobody heard a word about it
but as it always happens just went to decision have been made to chase the monster the monster put in no further appearances
the naval Arsenal's were unlocked for Commander Farragut who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his freaking
shipping and Mercantile Gazette Deloitte list Frances pocketbook and Maritime and Colonial review all the rags devoted to insurance companies who threatened to raise their premium rates were unanimous on this point
yeah GIF some so it truly is a scientific problem to be solved more practical people especially in America and England were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster to ensure the safety of transoceanic travel
I repeat opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent
enough of these fairy tales the time is change for me and harsh realities
but I mustn't let these fantasies run away with me
couldn't The Heart of the Ocean High the last remaining varieties of these Titanic species for him years or centuries and centuries millennia
what is Untold depth couldn't see keep alive such huge specimens of life from another age continuous alteration
our creator cast them using a colossal mole that time has gradually made smaller
the human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures
moreover the solution of proposed allowed for free play of the imagination
My article is hotly debated causing a fine old uproar
yet deep down I had accepted the existence of the monster
I left myself a loophole
these last words were cowardly of me but as far as I could I wanted to protect my professional dignity and not lay myself open to laughter from the Americans who when they do laugh laugh raucously
this inexplicable phenomenon is US explained away
so until information becomes more abundant I plump for see unicorn a colossal Dimensions no longer armed with a mere Lance but with an actual spur like Ironclad frigates or those warships called Rams whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously
imagine this weapon to be 10 times stronger than the animal 10 times more powerful launch it at a speed of 20 miles per hour x mass times its velocity and you get just the Collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe
all right then
which the Narwhal attacks within variable success
it's a king-size tooth is hard to steal
in essence the Narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword or Lance Sr naturalist have expressed it
it would have two proportions determined by the officers that the Shannon the instrument needed to preferite the Scotia and the power to pierce is Steamers Hall
increase its Dimensions five fold or even ten fold then give the cetacean a strength in proportion to its size will enlarging its offensive weapons and you have the animal we're looking for
if on the other hand we do know every living species we must look for the animal in question among those Marine creatures already cataloged and in this event I would be inclined to accept the existence of a giant narwhal
if we do not know every one of them if nature still keeps ichthyological secrets from us nothing is more miserable than to accept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new Genera animals with a basically cast-iron Constitution that inhabit strata beyond the reach of our soundings and which some developments are other inner door when if you prefer can bring to the upper level of the ocean for long range rifles
either we know every variety of creature populating our planet or we do not
however the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the form of a choice between two alternatives
it's almost Beyond conjecture
what is the constitution of these animals
What creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions 12 or 15 miles beneath the surface of the water
what goes on in Those Distant.
no sound James have been able to reach them
the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us
therefore I wrote after examining these different hypotheses one by one we are forced every other supposition having been refuted to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal
I discussed the question and it's every aspect both political and scientific and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article I published an issue of April 30th
since I can no longer hold my tongue I let it wag
I Can Fly
and in this Vein The Honorable Pierre aronnax professor at the Paris Museum was summoned by the New York Herald to formulate his views no matter what
but soon pain to the wall I had to explain myself straight out
I can find myself to a flat no comment
My Views were into man
in France I had published a two-volume work in quarto entitled The Mysteries of the great ocean depths
after I ride to New York several people did me the honour of Consulting you on the phenomenon in question
so after enquiries conducted in England France Russia Prussia Spain Italy America and even turkey the hypothesis of an underwater or monitor was ultimately rejected
Keeping a Secret Under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers
besides how could the Assembly of this underwater boat had escaped public notice
since the public interest was at stake and Transocean x-travel suffering
what does hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials in the various government
at least I hope it will
and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down
only some government could own such an engine of Destruction and it needs disaster fill times when men tax their Ingenuity to build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons it was possible that unknown to the rest of the world some Nation could have been testing such a fearsome machine
where and when he built it and how could he have built it in secret
the private individual has such a mechanism his disposal was less than probable
it couldn't stand up to increase conducted in both the new world and the old
so only two possible solutions to the question were left creating two very distinct groups of supporters
also just credited with the idea of a floating whole or some other enormous wreckage and again because of the speed of movement
when I arrived in New York
something was out there that much was certain and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on the scotia's wound
finding it impossible to for many views I drifted from one extreme to the other
this mystery puzzles me
there are diving suits were removed not without difficulty
the inside door opened and we passed into the Wardrobe
I heard pumps operating within the ship I felt the water lowering around me and in a few moments the cell was completely empty
then he pressed a button
half an hour later Guided by its electric Trail we reach the Nautilus
raising us with their brownish fins and miraculously we escaped a danger greater than encountering a tiger deep in the jungle
luckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight
they were like monstrous fireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in there Iron Jaws
they were blue sharks dull glassy stairs and phosphorescent matter oozing from Holes around their snouts
I saw that we were under threat from a fearsome pair of sharks
my blood turn cold in my veins
I was stretched out on the sea floor directly beneath some bushes of algae when I raised my head and spied to enormous masses hurtling by throwing off phosphorus and glimmers
at first I didn't know what to make of this sudden assault but I was reassured to observe the captain lying motionless beside me
with his powerful hands he sent me buckling to the ground while His companion did the same Pick n Save
I was lagging behind some Twenty Paces
but I was Reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival
within 20 minutes we would be on board and there I could breathe easy again because my tanks current air supply seem to be quite low in oxygen
it was the Nautilus is Beacon
in all honesty I was dead tired by the time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away cutting through the darkness of the waters
for two hours we were sometimes lead over Plains of sand sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross
this incident did not interrupt our walk
it was an albatross of the finest species a wonderful specimen of these Open Sea fowl
the animal dropped electrocuted and its descent brought it within reach of our joint Hunter who promptly took possession of it
when it was just a few meters above the waves Captain Nemo's companion took aim and fired
quite clearly visible approached and hovered over us
on this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to Thrill the marrow of a hunter
swiftly skimming the surface of the sea
heavy clouds passed above us forming and fading swiftly but after thinking it over
another unusual effect
I could then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside of the waves but reflected upside down above us there appeared and identical band that duplicated our every movement and gesture and short a perfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked but with heads down and feet in the air
often the seafloor Rose to within two meters of the surface of the water
for an hour planes of Saint enrolled before our steps
Captain Nemo's companion picked up the animal loaded it on his shoulder and we took to the trail again
hunted and trapped by fishermen this valuable carnivore has become extremely rare and it takes Refuge chiefly in the northernmost parts of the Pacific where in all likelihood its species will soon be facing extinction
it was a magnificent sea otter from the genus and Hydra
a shot went off I heard a faint hissing and it animal dropped a few Paces away literally struck by lightning
just then I saw the captain's weapon spring to his shoulder and track a moving object through the bushes
at a depth of 10m we walked emit a swarm of small fish from every species more numerous than birds in the air more agile to but no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our eyes
with great promptus the light reappeared and grew stronger and the refraction of the sun already low on the horizon again ring the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum
but this return to the upper strata wasn't so sudden that decompression took place to quickly which could have led to Serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers
this new route very Steep and has very arduous quickly took as close to the surface of the sea
I noticed that we didn't follow the same path and returning to the Nautilus
our return Journey began
farther on lay a part of the globe he would no longer tread Under Foot
he had no desire to pass beyond them
here ended the domains of Captain Nemo
a gesture from him brought us to a halt and however much I wanted to clear this wall I had to stop
the captain stopped suddenly
a wall of superb rockstud the forest and posing and it's Cher mask
finally at around 4 this marvellous Excursion came to an end
several times I saw Captain Nemo stop and take Aim with his rifle then after sighting down its barrel for a few seconds he would straighten up and resume his walk
but if they did approach us at least they kept at a distance regrettable from the hunter standpoint
while we were walking I thought the lights of our room cork devices would automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata
the open sea plants had already left behind the increasingly are is seafloor where are prodigious number of animals were still swarming Zoo fights particulates mollusks and fish
I observed that vegetable life was disappearing more quickly than animal life
by turning a switch I established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral and the Sea lit up by our four lanterns
and say it and I followed suit
His companion did likewise
Captain Nemo had just activated his electric device
consequently I had begun to grope my way when suddenly I saw the glow of an intense white light
not a single object was visible past 10 pieces
thanks to the Perfection of our equipment we had sus gone 90 meters below the limit that nature had until then set on man's underwater excursions
it must have been nearly three when we reach the narrow Valley between High vertical walls
the seafloor kept sinking and it's significantly steeper slope took us to Greater depths
meanwhile I had assumed this rest. Would be the turning point in our stroll but I was mistaken and instead of heading back to the Nautilus Captain Nemo continued his daring Excursion
such thoughts hadn't previously crossed my mind and I was determined to keep on my guard
this encounter reminded me that other more daunting animals must be lurking in these dark reaches and my diving suit might not be adequate protection against their attacks
Captain Nemo alerted His companion to this hideous crustacean which a swing of the rifle but quickly brought down and I watched the monsters horrible legs writhing and Dreadful convulsions
just then could say it woke up together with the Nautilus is Sailor
although my diving suit was Heavy enough to protect me from this animals bites I couldn't keep back a shutter of Horror
a few Paces away a monstrous meter Hi-C spider was staring at me with beady eyes poised to Spring at me
and I had started to stretch my limbs when an unexpected Apparition brought me sharply to my feet
accordingly my eyes soon closed behind their heavy glass windows and I fell into an uncontrollable dose which until then I had been able to fight off only through the movements of our walking
but an exchange I experienced that irresistible desire for sleep that comes over every diver
what kept my stomach in such a good mood I'm unable to say
after four hours of strolling I was quite astonished not to feel any intense hunger
I saw a happy gleam and the Gallant Lads eyes and to communicate his pleasure and the world's silliest way
speaking for myself I was glad to oblige and we stretched out beneath an arbor of winged kelp whose Long send tendrils stood up like arrows
near one Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt
these various types of Shrubbery where is biggest trees in the temperate zones and The Damp shade between them there were clustered actual bushes of moving flowers Hedges of zoo fights in which their group Stony Coral striped with twisting furrows yellowish sea anemone from the genus while they're Rose underfoot like a Covey of snipe yellow fish from the genus lapicero campus with bristling jaws and sharp scales flying gunners
as one with t naturalist put it the animal kingdom blossoms and the vegetable Kingdom doesn't
but not yet pressed and dried like the Nautilus is specimens some peacock Tails spread open like fans to stir up a cooling breeze sea Tangled stretching out their young and edible shoots twisting strings of kelp from the genus narrow situs that bloom to a height of 15 M bouquets of mermaid cups whose stems grew wider at the top and a number of other open sea plants without flowers it's an odd anomaly in this bizarre element
these plants are entirely self-propagating and the principle of their existence lies and the water that sustains and nourishes them
they had no roots and didn't care what solid objects secured them sand shells husks are Pebbles they didn't ask their hosts for sustenance just a point of purchase
attached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift method
but for a few minutes I kept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms mistaken exude fights for water plants
hear the range of underwater Flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me as well as more abundant than it might have been in the Arctic or tropical zones we're such accidents are less common
the seafloor in this forest was strewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid
likewise to the comparative Darkness surrounding us
chicas plants and creepers were growing and stiff perpendicular lines governed by the density of the element that generated them
every filament are ribbon no matter how sin stood ramrod straight
they all rose right up towards the surface of the ocean
none of the weeds carpeting the seafloor none of the branches bristling from the Shrubbery crept Orland are stretched on a horizontal plane
this forest was made up of big tree like plants and when we entered beneath their huge arches my eyes were instantly struck by the unique arrangement of their branches and Arrangement that I had never before encountered
what other folder Pioneer would come ax in hand to clear away it's dark underbrush
an underwater Forest  we had finally arrived on the outskirts of this Forest
but we could see well enough to find our way and it still wasn't necessary to activate the ruhmkorff device
a midpoint between day and night
arriving at this 300-foot Depp's I still detected the sun's rays but just barely
helped by the water my movements were executed with startling he's
as for the exhaustion down to accompany a two-hour stroll and such unfamiliar trappings it was no
I felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers and even this discomfort soon disappeared
hemispheres but my diving clothes were built along such lines that I never suffered from this pressure
by which point we were undergoing a pressure of 10
I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun's rays which were no longer refracted
it was almost noon
we had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half
because just as 40,000 near invisible but have been counted in one 5 square millimeter space so also have phucas plants been gathered that were over 500 M long
this family produces both the biggest and smallest vegetables in the world
these algae are a genuine Prodigy of creation one of the wonders of world Florida
the surface of the water was crisscrossed by a floating Arbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant LG family that numbers more than two
but wildest Greenery was sprawling under our steps it didn't neglect us over head
soft to the foot these densely textured Lawns what have rivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of band
then we crossed a prairie of algae open sea plants that the waters hadn't yet torn loose who's vegetation grew and wild profusion
all these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile
and we went for it while overhead their scudded schools of Portuguese man-of-war that let their ultramarine tentacles drift and their wakes Medusa's who's milky white or dainty pink parasols and shaded us from the sun's rays
it fills me with real sugar into Crush underfoot the gleaming mollusk samples that litter the seafloor by the thousands concentric cone shells Hammer sells seashells that actually hop around top shell snails red helmet shells angel wing Cox sea hares and so many other exhibits from this inexhaustible ocean
various Isis Coral corn you Larry and coral living in isolation Tufts of virginal genus oculina formerly known by the name white Coral prickly fungus coral and the shape of mushrooms sea anemone Holding On by their muscular discs providing a literal flower bed adorned by jellyfish from the gene for pizza and Starfish The Spangled the sand including they like feather stars from the genus astrophytum that were like fine lace embroidered by the hands of water notes their festoons swaying to the faint undulations caused by our walking
obviously in the presence of the zoo fight and mollusks specimens the fine lad was classifying his head off
Isaiah like me had stopped before the splendid sight
so for lack of anything better I talked to myself ID claimed inside this copper box that topped my head spending more air on Empty Words then was perhaps advisable
if only I had known how to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signal
if only I had been able to share with concea the intense Sensations rising in my brain competing with him and exclamations of wonderment
this Riot of rainbow tents with a Wonder A Feast for the eyes a genuine Kaleidoscope of red green yellow orange violet indigo and blue and short the whole pallet of a color happy painter
the sun's Rays hit the surface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle decomposing by refraction as though passing through a prism and when this light came in contact with flowers rocks buds seashells and polyps the edges of these objects were shaded with all seven Hues of a solar Spectrum
by then it was 10 in the morning
I recognized the lower slopes of some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zuphite specimens and right off I was struck by an effect unique to the medium
soon scarcely blurred by their distance from us the forms of some objects took shape before my eyes
my hands part of liquid curtains that closed again behind me and my foot prints faded swiftly under the waters pressure
but when night fell in the midst of the waters the ship's Beacon would surely facilitate our return on board since it's raised carried with perfect distinctness
will anyone believe me if I assert that at this 30-foot depths I could see as if it was broad daylight
the outcome an immense Vista of Reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule
this dazzling carpet was a real mirror throwing back the sun's Rays with startling intensity
we were walking on Sand that was fine grained and smooth not wrinkles like beach sand which preserves The Impressions left by the waves
above me I could see the calm surface of the ocean
truly this water surrounding me was just a kind of air denser than the atmosphere on land but almost as transparent
farther on the bottom was tinted with fine shades of ultramarine then off in the distance it turned blue and Faded in the midst of a hazy Darkness
I could easily distinguish objects a hundred meters away
the solar rays easily crossed the sequias mass and dispersed it's dark colors
the sun a star honest me with its power
I was no longer and inert mass and I had comparatively speaking great freedom of movement
all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced and thanks to this law of physics discovered by Archimedes I did just fine
when even the painter's brush can't depict the effects unique to the liquid element how can the writer's pen hope to reproduce them
words are powerless to describe such wonders
contrived in the Nautilus is side A second door then opened
apparently a stop cock inside the boat was letting and water from outside which over ran us and soon filled up the room
I felt a distinct sensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest
after some minutes he's sharp hissing reached my ears
I heard a door with watertight seals closed after us and we were surrounded by profound Darkness
toad in the same way my companions went with me
but this circumstance had been foreseen because I felt my self propelled into a little room adjoining the Wardrobe
but in all honesty while imprisoned in these heavy clothes and nailed to the deck by my LED Souls it was impossible for me to take a single step
the rum korff lamp hanging from my belt my rifle in hand I was ready to go forth
placed on our backs the roll cray roll device went into operation as soon as it was in position and for my part I could breathe with ease
three holes protected by heavy glass allowed us to see in any direction was simply a turn of the head inside the sphere
on top the suit ended in a collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet with screwed
can say it and I did the same but not without hearing the Canadian toss us a sarcastic Happy Hunting
I ask only to put it to the test
Captain Nemo I said this is an ideal easy-to-use weapon
as soon as one shot had been fired another was ready to go off
and it grew for the but was heaviest a cartridge clip held some 20 electric bullets that by means of a spring automatically took their places in the barrel of the rifle
this serve does it take for the compressed air which a trigger operated valve could release into the metal chamber
one of the Nautilus has been presented me with a streamlined rifle whose but was boilerplate steel hollow inside and a fairly large dimensions
but before proceeding with this operation I asked the captain for permission to examine the rifles set aside for us
all that remained was to encase one's head and it's metal sphere
can say it and I were soon dressed in these diving suits
these perfected diving suits it was easy to see where a far cry from such misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates leather jumpers seagoing tunics invented an acclaimed in the 18th century
the fabric of the jacket was reinforced with copper male that shielded the chest protected it from the waters pressure and allowed the lungs to function freely the sleeves ended and supple gloves that didn't impede hand movements
these clothes consisted of jackets and pants
they were like suits of armor that we're both yielding and resistant you might say
at the captain summons to crew Men came to help us put on these heavy waterproof clothes made from seamless India Rubber and expressly designed to Bear considerable pressures
where Master goes I go conseil are applied
Ned asked
and is conseil a going to risk it
no one will force you missed Earl and Captain Nemo said
have it your way sir the harpooner replied shrugging his shoulders but speaking for myself I'll never get into those things unless they force me
it has to be mr.
and you Professor aronnax are you going to stick yourself inside these clothes
put in the disappointed harpooner watching his dreams of fresh meat fade away
but my Gallant Ned I told him the forest of Crespo Island are simply underwater forests
after seeing these netteland exhibited an obvious distaste for the idea of putting one on
hanging from its walls a doesn't diving outfits were waiting for anybody who wanted to take a stroll
the cell properly speaking what's the Nautilus has Arsenal and wardrobe
it really said traddles put mr. micawber quite out of my head the letter mr. micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter was addressed to me by the kindness of tea travels Esquire of the inner Temple it ran us my dear Copperfield you may possibly not be I'm prepared to receive the information that something has turned up
I hardly know which was the better pleased traddles RI
you're starving now Trotwood said Mr Dick shaking hands with me in a corner I'll provide for her sir and do floors just 10 fingers in the air as if they were 10 Banks
he was like one under the propitious influence of a charm from the moment of his being usefully employed and if there were a happy man in the world that Saturday night it was the Grateful creature who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in existence and me the most wonderful young man
in a word although we took great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him and although he did not begin with the beginning of a week he earned by the following Saturday night 10 Shillings and ninepence to all the shops in the neighborhood to change this treasure in the six fences or his bringing them to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter with tears of joy and pride in his eyes
my aunt reported to us afterwards that at first he was like a man playing the kettledrums and constantly divided his attention is between the two but that finding this confusion fatigue him and having his copy there plainly before his eyes he soon sat at it in an orderly businesslike manner and postponed the memorial to a more convenient time
we exhorted him to be Resolute in this and left my aunt to observe him
are instructions to mr. dick where did he should copy exactly what he had before him without the least departure from the original and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the first he should fly to the memorial
on the table by the window in Buckingham Street we set out the work travel prepared for him which was to make I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial
wouldn't that make a difference Copperfield
dick has nothing to do with them
but these writings you know that I speak of her already drawn up and finished said traddles after a little consideration
explain the traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the first out of mr. Dix manuscript mr. dick in the meanwhile looking very differentially and seriously it travels and sucking his thumb
tell him about the memorial said Mr dick
mr. dick should kids inside
a Trotwood I shook my head
don't you think that travels you could copy writing sir if I got them for you mister Jacob doubtfully at me
paddles who would not have smile for the world replied composedly but you are a very good Penman sir
I have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all others
UC said Mr Dick wistfully if I could have hurt myself mr. travels if I could beat a drum or blow anything poor fellow
I passed that off and brought mr. dick on the carpet
I'll begin tomorrow friends looked astonished as he well might but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous condition
prattles reasonably suppose that this would settle the business but I only feeling that here indeed wear a few tall trees to be healing down immediately result to work my way onto Dora through this Thicket ax in hand I'm very much obliged to you my dear travel said I
but the mirror mechanical acquisition necessary except in rare cases for thorough excellence in it that is to say a perfect and entire command of the mystery of shorthand writing and reading was about equal in difficulty to the Mastery of six languages
paddles having mentioned newspapers to me as one of his hopes I had put the two things together and told travels in my letter that I wish to know how I could qualify myself for this Pursuit
the first subject on which I had to consult traddles was this I had heard that many men distinguished in various Pursuits had begun Life by reporting the debates in Parliament
mr. dick professed an absolute certainty of having seen them before and we both said very likely
he received this cord jelly and made friends with Mr dick in the moment
we found him hard at work with his inkstand in papers refreshed by the side of the flower pot stand in the little round table in the corner of the small
before we went I wrote travels a full statement of all that had happened and travels wrote me back a capital answer expressive of his sympathy and friendship
seriously apprehending that his malady would increase unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful which would be better I made up my mind to try if battles could help us
in this condition he felt more incapable of finishing the memorial than ever and the harder he worked at the author that unlucky head of King Charles the first got into it
I took mr. dick with me because acutely sensitive to my aunt's reverses and sincerely believing that no galley-slave or convict worked as I did he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and appetite is having nothing useful to do
mr. Could have been with me to Highgate twice already and had resumed just companionship with the doctor I took with me
not satisfied with all these proceedings but burning with impatience to do something more I went to see traddles now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street hole
in the meantime to put myself on a short allowance of bears Greece holy abandoned scented soap and lavender water and sold out three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice as being too luxurious for my Stern career
I had not revealed myself in my alter character to Dory yet because she was coming to see Miss meals in a few days and I deferred all I had to tell her until then merely informing her in my letters all our Communications were secretly forward it through Miss meals that I had much to tell her
but I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged and never walks slowly on any account and felt enthusiastically that the more I tired myself the more I was doing to deserve Dora
I was pretty busy now up at 5 in the morning and home at 9 or 10 at night
there was a soft wind shade upon her face thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room and I thought all the way to doctors Commons of the night when I had seen it looking at him as he read
when I left at 9 she was kneeling on the ground at the doctor's feet putting on his shoes and Gators for him
I often glanced at it for she said in the window all the time we were at work and made our breakfast which we took by snatches as we were employed
she did not look very happy I thought but it was a good face or a very false one
she had not but it sent into London to put her cousin off and they're going out in the afternoon to see Agnes and had prevailed upon the doctor to go with her and they had walked home by the field the doctor told me the evening being delightful
I was curious to find out next morning whether she had been
this concluded he went to his Patton Place I suppose but at all events went away on his horse looking very Idol
so the doctor persisted in making the engagement for her and mr. Jack maldon was to come back to dinner
moreover he said he wanted to hear her sing all the new singer songs to him and how could she do that well unless you win
he told her good-naturedly that she was young and ought to be amused and entertained and must not allow herself to be made doll by Adele old fellow
but he saw enough
I would much rather we made it home without looking at her cousin she then addressed me and asked me about Agnes and whether she should see her and whether she was not likely to come that day and was so much disturb that I wondered how even the doc you're buttering his toast could be blind what was so obvious
I prefer to remain at home
I would rather not she said to the doctor
the doctor ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife turned to her and said you must go and you must go
she is perfectly Exquisite besides which she is so charmingly ugly relaxing in the Langer
it's the last goodnight there will be this season and there's a singer there who she really ought to hear
perhaps it impressed me the more then because it was new to me but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of order strengthen my confidence
I have seen it displayed with such success that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen we might as well have been born caterpillar
I have known it very fashionable indeed
the doctor looked grave then there's no news at all and no news they say is good news
nothing at all sir replied mr. Mall
fire the doctor
is there any news today
I find it bores me
I hardly ever take breakfast sir he replied with his head thrown back in an easy chair
said the doctor
have you breakfasted this morning mr. Jack
what is Langer all together was quite a wonderful sight except when he addressed himself to his cousin Annie
send the doctor Copperfield mr. Jack maldon shook hands with me but not very warmly I believed and with an air of languid patronage and which I secretly took great umbrage
it was mr. Jack Moore
a gentleman on Horseback came to the gate and leading his horse into the little court with the bridal over his arm as if we were quite at home tied him to a ring in the empty Coach House wall and came into the breakfast parlor whip in hand
we had not been seated long when I saw an approaching arrival in mrs. strong space before I heard any sound of it
they have postponed their breakfast on my account and we sat down to table together
our plans being us arrange to our mutual satisfaction the doctor took me into the house to present me to miss a strong when we found in the doctor's new study Dusty his books a freedom which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favor
on Sundays of course I was to rest also and I consider these very easy terms
we would have worked two hours every morning in two or three hours every night except on Saturdays when I was to rest
the doctor was quite happy in the prospect of are going to work together on that wonderful performance and we settled to begin next morning at 7
afterwards when we were fairly at our work I found mr. Jack mauldin's efforts more Troublesome to me than I had expected as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes but it gets so many soldiers and ladies heads over the doctors manuscript that I often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity
his papers were in a little confusion in consequence of mr. Jack maldon having lately private is occasional Services as an amanuensis and that being accustomed to that occupation but we should soon put right what was it Miss and go on swimmingly
he told me that since his retirement from Scholastic life he had been advancing with it wonderfully and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work as it was his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap
his pockets were as full of it as his head
it is the dictionary  how could it be anything else
the doctor stopped smiling Lee clapped me on the shoulder again and explain but the Triumph most delightful to behold as if I had penetrated the profound two steps of mortal sagacity my dear young friend you have hit
said the doctor which he had always made a very grave appeal to the honor of us boys on my word search
on your word now
and when you can do better you will
to think that so little should go for so much
so the doctor innocently
if you will take such time as I have and that is my mornings and evenings and can think it worth 70 pounds a year you will do me such a service as I cannot express
I've always taken an annual present and do a count
undoubtedly said the doctor still walking me up and down with his hand on my shoulder
not that I mean to say it's rigidly limited to 70 pounds a year because I have always contemplated making any young friend I might does employ a present to
to think of that
by the dock
it doubles our income doctor strong today
but my good young friend what's 70 lb year
well well said the doctor that strew certainly you're having a profession and being actually engaged in studying it makes a difference
you have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon and is it not a Pity that you should devote the springtime of your life to such a poor for soon as I can offer I became very glowing again and expressing myself in a Rhapsody. Isle I am afraid Verge my request strongly reminding the doctor that I had already a profession
you achieve distinction you know when you were with us you were qualified for many good things
it's very gratifying and agreeable to me I am sure but don't you think you could do better
the doctor walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder and His Kind face turned encouragingly to mine went on  now my dear Copperfield in reference to this proposal of yours
Miracle hymn said the doctor was quite vexed about him poor thing so we have got him at home again and we have bought him a little Patton Place which agrees with him much better  I knew enough of mr. Jack maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do and which was pretty well paid
and in that short time
forgotten the old Soldier
this is Marco humbio not forgotten mrs. Markle
mr. Jack Malden couldn't bear the client my dear
set the doctor yes
India
I inquired
has he come home soon
of course so the doctor to be sure he's pretty well too
perfectly sir
and yes to be sure you recollect mr. Jack maldon Copperfield
you were always her favorite
said the doctor and he's quite well and she'll be delighted to see you
I am delighted to see you
how do you do
when he did and came towards me he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments evidently without thinking about me at all and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure and he took me by both him and let major Copperfield so the doctor you are a man
knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance I made bold to open the gate and walk after him so as to meet him when he should turn around
he had his old companions about him to for there were plenty of high trees in the neighborhood and two or three rocks were on the grass looking after him as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury Brook and we're observing him closely and consequence
when I approached the doctors Cottage that have the look of being just completed I saw him walking in the garden at the side Gators and all as if he had never left off walking since the days of my pupil
an old red brick mansion used as a school was in its place and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at as I recollect
the church with the Slender Spire that stands on the top of the hill now was not there then to tell me the time
I came softly away from my place of observation and avoiding that part of the neighborhood and wishing I had not gone near it strolls about until it was 10
she gave me the idea of some Fierce thing that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro Upon A Beaten Track and wearing It's Hard Out
the conservatory doors were standing open and Rosa dartle was walking bear headed with a quick impetuous step up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn
his room was shut up close
when I had made this discovery I went back in and attraction I could not resist to Elaine by Mrs steerforth and looked over the corner of the Garden Wall
it was not in that part of Highgate Where Mrs steerforth lived but quiet on the opposite side of the little town
my first care after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation was to find the Doctor's house
I came out again harder and faster than ever and dashed up to Highgate at such a rate that I was there an hour too early and though I had not been should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself before I was at all presentable
it would do for me and Dora admirably with a little front garden for Jeep to run about in and bark at the tradespeople through the railings and a capital room upstairs for my aunt
in this state I went into a cottage that I saw was to let and examined it narrowly for I felt it necessary to be practical
I stimulated myself into such a heat and got so out of breath that I felt as if I had been earning I don't know how much
I had a good mind to ask an old man in why are spectacles who is breaking Stones upon the road to lend me his hammer for a little while and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite
I got into such a transport that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty under circumstances that should prove my strength
Dora was the reward and Dora must be one
great was the labor price list the reward
but that did not discourage me with the new life came you purpose new intention
and I went on it a mighty rate as if it could be done by walking when I found myself on the familiar Highgate Road pursuing such a different Aaron from that old one of pleasure with which it was Associated it seemed as if a complete change it come on my whole life
but I had to do was to take my Woodman's axe in my hand and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty but cutting down the trees until I came to door
but I had to do was to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account by going to work with a Resolute and steady heart
but I had to do was to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible ungrateful object
my whole manner of thinking of our late Misfortune was changed
I was not dispirited now I Was Not Afraid of the shabby coat and had no urine he's after Galant Gray
we won't mention the subject to one another anymore neither of course will you mention it to anybody else
now you know the beginning middle and end all about it

there my dear
I was a fool but I married him and I am so far and incurable full and that subject that for the sake of what I once believed him to be I wouldn't have even the shadow of my idle fancy hardly dealt with four I was in Earnest Trot if ever a woman was and soothe her dress
but sooner than have him punished for his offenses as he would be if get filed about in this country I gave him more money than I can afford at intervals when he reappears to go away
his nut to me now Trot less than nothing
but he was a fine-looking man when I married him said my aunt with an echo of her Old Pride and admiration undertone  and when I believe him I was a fool to be the soul of Honor  she gave my hand to squeeze and shook her head
he stood me ducks and Drakes of what I gave him sink lower and lower marries another woman I believe they came in Adventurer a gambler and a cheat what he is now you see me
he had been so cruel to me that I might have affected a separation on easy terms for myself but I did not
I may say at the distance of time Trot that I left him generously
I left him my aunt preceded laying her hand as usual on the back of mine generously
my dear could ant
so she put all that sort of sentiment once and forever in a grave and filled it up and flattened it down
he repaid her by breaking her fortune and nearly breaking her heart
Betsey Trotwood semi aunt composedly but the time wasn't right when she believed in that man most entirely when she loved him Trot right well  when there was no roof attachment and affection that she would not have given him
I thought he had been dead
your husband and
Trott said my aunt call me it's my husband
then she came out and took a seat beside me
who is he
said I hardly
we all need one another narrowly and passing and with no favor
in spite of himself here. Abashed by my aunt's Indigent tears and came slouching out of the garden
it's all very fine
he returned
go and repent of it
you treated me falsely ungratefully and cruelly
I lead the life of an owl
I have to come shabby enough if you mean that he said
haven't got it why do you give me the pain of looked at you for another moment and seen what you have become
I have told you so
it is all I can give you said my aunt
with a heart you must have until at length he said  is this all you mean to give me then
return my aunt
said he you asked me why
and why don't you abandoned me to my desk
why do I ask
you Batman return my aunt with great emotion how can you use miso
you may take it back
that I can't go said he here
I could spare no more return my aunt
he demanded
she was agitated whole some money into his hand
the light in the passage was obscured for a moment and I asked him out
after stooping to put the bottle on the ground he looked up at the windows and looked about
as if it were the first time he had seen it
I stopped short among the thick foliage outside for the moon was up now Philip secured and I recognized the man who I had one supposed to be a delusion of mr. Dix he was eating as well as drinking and seemed to eat with a hungry appetite
yellow glass and bottle in his hand and was in the act of drinking
it was with very great surprise that I saw a man standing in her little garden
thinking of my aunt might have relapsed into one of her old alarms and might be watching the progress of some imaginary conflagration in the distance I went to speak to her
I had reached my own gate and it was standing listing for the Deep bells of Saint Paul's the sound of which I thought had been born towards me among the multitude of striking clocks when I was rather surprised to see that the door for my aunt's Cottage was open and that a faint light in the entryway shining out across the road
it was midnight when I arrived at home
there was a doodoo and thoughtful compassionate him that I was at no loss to interpret
he being of the same mind and equally Reliance on her we suffered her to take her own Road and took hours which was toward Highgate
I had such implicit confidence in her declaration that I then put it to Mr Pega T whether it would not seem in the onset like distrusting her to follow her any farther
Tigard we followed her at a short distance our way lying in the same direction until we came back into the lighted and populist streets
she had been ill probably for a long time I observed upon that closer opportunity of observation that she was warned
I know no more and I can say no more  against you repress the tears that had begun to flow and putting out a trembling hand and touching the stripetti as if there was some healing virtue and him went away Along the desolate Road
I am to be trusted for the first time in a long while with my miserable life on account of what you have given me to try for
if any good should come of me I might begin to hope for nothing but harm has ever come of my Deeds yet
we can all do some good if we will she trembled and her lips Shook and her face was paler as she answered
in the name of the great judge that I dismissed that terrible idea
to give me money would be to take away your trust to take away the object that you have given me
I cannot do what I have promised for money she replied I could not take it if I was starving
at least take some assistance I returned until you have tried
there may be worked we got she said I'll try
I represent it to her that Mr Pega T could not be called for one in his condition poor depending on her own resources shocked us both
mr. Peggy suggested to me in a whisper what had already occurred to myself and I took out my purse but I could not Prevail upon her to accept any money nor could I exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time
I asked her where she loved herself
under a double lamp in the road I rode our two addresses on a leave of my pocketbook which I tore out and gave to her and what she put in her for busam
where we were to be communicated with if occasion should arise
she's not raise her voice above her breath or address us but said this to the night sky then stood for family quiet
if you are not true to it by the end it's passing away from her leave her more forlorn and more despairing if that were possible then she had been upon the river's Brink that night and then Midol help human and divine renounce her Evermore
we both replied together yes  she lifted up her eyes and solemnly declared that she would devote herself to this task for Bentley and Faithfully that she would never waver in it never be diverted from it never relinquish it well there is any chance of Hope
if I should ever find her shelter her if I have any shelter to divide with her and then without her knowledge come to you and bring you to her she asked her and lie
Poland freeze
she asked in a low voice of astonished
will you trust me
and may heaven reward you  she looked at him hastily and for the first time as if she were doubtful of what he had said
you're thankful to her and you love her
I knew she always was to all
bless her I knew she was
you spoke of her being Pleasant kind and gentle to you
according to our Reckoning he proceeded and mine she is like one day to make her own poor solitary course to London
hello she ain't no call to doubt my love and doing it and doing their shame steps in and keeps the twist us  I read and every word of his plane impressive way of delivering himself new evidence of his having thought of this one Topic in every feature it presented
where to buy said he I know both that she would go to the world's first in with me if she could want to see me again to keep off seeing me
maybe you can guess it if you would have such a friend you have gotten to a way of being fond of him and course of time as she was silently trembling he put a shawl carefully about her taking it up from the ground for that purpose
she stood drinking leave for him as if she were afraid to meet his eyes but her passionate sorrow was quite hushed and mute
listen now his influence upon her was complete
you don't understand what it is we had before us
will you pause the moment then went on you don't understand how it is that this here gentleman and me as wish to speak to you
forbid as I of all men should do that my girl
Martha said Mr Piketty God forbid is I should judge you
he looked upon her and when she was silent gently raised her
kill me for being what I am and having ever known her but don't think that of me
throw me away is all the world does
I don't think that all the power I had of loving anything is quite worn out
I only stay with all my guilt and wretchedness upon my head then I am grateful to her for my soul and love her
I know there was a long long way between us
I don't complain
it would be burning shame upon you even now if she and I exchanged a word
when she was your pride
stamp upon me kill me
how can I go on as I am a solitary cursed myself a living disgrace to everyone I come near suddenly she turned to my companion
drooping her head as if it were heavy with insupportable recollections
long and used to any self-control the piercing Agony her Morse and grief was terrible
and when I heard what happened for that snowy night from some belonging to our town cried Martha the bitterest thought it and all I mind she wants kept company with me and what's a haiku
but I lost everything that makes life dear the worst of all my thoughts was that I was parted for ever 4 / Mr piggity standing with one hand in the gunwale of the boat and his eyes cast down
knowing but I am myself so well
she never spoke a word to me but was pleasant and right
with most forlorn regret but she was always good to me
you are innocent of any part in it we thoroughly believe we know
the cause of a flight is too well understood I said
I never could have kept out of it a single Winter's Night if I had not been free of any share in that
I should have been on the river long ago she said glancing at it with a terrible expression if any wrong to her had been a pain in my mind
it was said I
was it user
it was you if I don't deceive myself she said in a broken voice that came into the kitchen the night she took such pity on me was so gentle to me didn't shrink away from me like all the rest and gave me such kind help
it has never been attributed to you I return earnestly responding to earnestness
but tell him sir  she had shrunk away from him if you don't feel too hard to me to do it that never was
I have no hope at all
I want to say nothing for myself she said after a few moments I am bad I'm lost
for not having driven her away from the door
are you composed enough to try to speak on a subject was so interested you I hope Heaven may remember it that's snowy night
she shook his head she looked neither him nor at me but stood in a humble attitude and pressing the other clenched against her forehead
knowing that the state must pass before we could speak to her it with any hope I ventured to restrain him when he would have raised her and we stood by in silence until she became more triangle
a new burst of crying came up on her now and what she wants more hitter face among the stones and lay before us a prostrate image of humiliation and ruin
I don't know what he would have said an answer he made some motion with his mouth and seemed to think he had spoken but he had only pointed to her with his outstretched hand
I never saw in any painting or reality horror and compassion so impressively Blended
I thought has to my mind that in the face of my companion as he looked upon her without speech or motion I might have read his nieces history if I had known nothing of
oh the Dreadful River
or that's fit for me
I can't forget it
I can't keep away from
it comes from country places where there was once no harm in it and it creeps through the Dismal streets defiled and miserable and it goes away like my life to a great sea that is always trouble and I feel that I must go with it except in the tone of those words
I know that it's the natural company of such as I am
I know that I belong to it
I know it's like me she exclaimed
but you still repeated the same words continually explaining O the River over and over again
hush hush
the river
she cried passionately
show the river
we carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones and their later down crying and moaning  in a little while she sat among the stones holding her wretched head with both your hands
but a stronger hand in mine was laid upon her and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw whose it was she made but one more effort and dropped down between us
I know and never can forget that there was that in her wild matter which gave me no Assurance but that she would sink before my eyes until I had her arm within my grasp
I think she was talking to herself
I did not approach her solitary figure without trembling where does gloomy into her determined walk and the way in which she stood almost with the cavernous shadow of the Iron Bridge looked at the lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide inspired a dread with me
I then signed Mister Pega T to remain where he was and he emerged from their shade to speak to her
there are some boats and barges The Strand in the mud and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen
the girl we had followed straight down to the river's Brink and stood in the midst of this night picture lonely and still looking at the water
it was a story that one of the pits dug for the dead in the time of the Great Plague was here about and a blighting influences seem to have proceeded from it over the whole place or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that nightmare condition out of the overflowing of the polluted stream
so I need gaps and causeway's winding among old wooden piles with a sickly substance clean to the ladder fluttering above high-water Mark let down through the use and slush to the ebb tide
the clanking calero sundry fiery Works upon the Riverside A Rose by night to destroy everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that poured out of their chimneys
in another the ground was covered with rusty iron Monsters of steam boilers Wheels cranks pipes furnaces paddles anchors diving Bells windmill sales and I know not what strange objects accumulated by some spectacular and groveling into dust underneath which having sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet weather they have the appearance of family trying to hide themselves
